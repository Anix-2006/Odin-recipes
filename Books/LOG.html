    <p><b>Where power is inherited, loyalty is tested, and love is the most dangerous game of all.</b></p>
    <p>
        In the Legacy of Gods series, dynasties rule not only with wealth and influence, but with secrets that can shatter empires. 
        Every heir carries the burden of a name that commands fear, respect, and envyâ€”yet behind the polished facades lie obsessions, 
        betrayals, and forbidden desires. Rina Kent weaves a world where ambition is a weapon, passion is a battlefield, and surrender 
        is never without a cost. It is a seductive journey into the hearts of the powerful, where the stakes are as personal as they are perilous.
